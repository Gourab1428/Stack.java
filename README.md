Here's a professional `README.md` file for your Java Stack implementation project:

# 📚 Stack Implementation in Java

This project demonstrates a basic **Stack** implementation using Java. It features essential stack operations like `push`, `pop`, and `display`, with a user-friendly console interface for interaction.

## 📌 Features

* Fixed-size stack (size = 10)
* Console-based menu-driven interface
* Push operation with overflow check
* Pop operation with underflow check
* Display all elements in the stack

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* Java (JDK 8 or later)
* Scanner class for user input
* Array-based stack implementation

## 📂 File Structure

* `Stack.java` – Contains the logic for stack operations (`push`, `pop`, and `display`)
* `StackData.java` – Contains the `main` method and user menu interface

## 📦 How to Run

1. Make sure you have Java installed. You can check using:

   ```bash
   java -version
   ```

2. Compile the code:

   ```bash
   javac StackData.java
   ```

3. Run the program:

   ```bash
   java StackData
   ```

## 💡 Sample Menu Output

```
____________________________
Welcome to Stack Operation
___________________________
Press 1 for push operation
Press 2 for pop operation
Press 3 for display operation
Press 4 to exit
Enter your choice:
```

## ⚠️ Known Issues

* The menu currently prints "push operation" for all options (1–4). It should be corrected to:

  ```
  Press 1 for push operation
  Press 2 for pop operation
  Press 3 for display operation
  Press 4 to exit
  ```

## 📖 Concepts Covered

* Stack Data Structure
* Array-based memory handling
* Java conditionals and loops
* Scanner input handling

## ✅ Example Use Case

This project is useful for understanding how LIFO (Last In First Out) data structures work, and is great for beginners learning Java or preparing for technical interviews.
